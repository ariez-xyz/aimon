# Obtaining RobustTrees predictions

1. Run `setup.sh` to fetch the RobustTrees repo and build the binaries
2. Run the `infer_*.sh` scripts to train robust as well as unrobust models, obtain their predictions on the test and training data, and save their output data in csv format to be used with the monitor.
